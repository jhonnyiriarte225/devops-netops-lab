# DevOps / NetOps Lab (AWS + Terraform + Ansible + WireGuard)
AWS + Terraform + Ansible + WireGuard + Runbooks (sanitized)

Hi! I'm Johnny Iriarte. This repository is my hands-on lab to document and ship real, reproducible infrastructure and operations work: AWS provisioning with Terraform, configuration automation with Ansible, and practical NetOps/SRE runbooks (VPN, monitoring, troubleshooting).

## What I'm building
A small but realistic platform that reflects how I work in production environments:
- **AWS**: VPC + EC2 (and later: remote state, IAM best practices)
- **Terraform (IaC)**: reproducible infrastructure with clear modules and outputs
- **Ansible**: idempotent automation for server setup (WireGuard, system hardening basics)
- **WireGuard / VPN operations**: documentation + troubleshooting runbooks
- **Observability**: monitoring notes and examples (Zabbix today; Prometheus/Grafana later)

## Repository structure
- `docs/` — architecture, runbooks, notes
- `terraform/` — infrastructure as code (VPC, EC2, later modules)
- `ansible/` — playbooks + roles (sanitized)
- `scripts/` — helper scripts (sanitized)

## Current status
- [ ] Week 1: repo foundation + runbooks + architecture diagram
- [ ] Week 2: Terraform VPC + EC2
- [ ] Week 3: Docker + Nginx reverse proxy
- [ ] Week 4: CI/CD (GitHub Actions) + basic deploy

## Weekly updates
- **Week 1 (YYYY-MM-DD)** — Repo setup, SSH notes, WireGuard runbook, architecture diagram
- **Week 2 (YYYY-MM-DD)** — Terraform VPC + EC2 + documentation
- **Week 3 (YYYY-MM-DD)** — Docker + Nginx + health checks
- **Week 4 (YYYY-MM-DD)** — CI/CD pipeline + deploy workflow

## Notes on privacy & security
